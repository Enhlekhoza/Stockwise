# Datasets Required for Current StockWise Features

Based on the "Core AI-Powered Features (Current Prototype Focus)" outlined in your `Project-spec.md`, here are the features that require datasets for their AI capabilities:

## 1. The AI-Powered Countertop (Automated POS)

*   **Visual Product Recognition:**
    *   **Dataset Needs:** A dataset of images of various retail products, ideally with bounding box annotations for object detection. This dataset would be used to train the AI to identify products in real-time from a camera feed.
    *   **Kaggle Search Terms:** "retail product detection," "grocery product images," "object detection retail," "product recognition."

*   **Cash Recognition:**
    *   **Dataset Needs:** A dataset of images of different currency notes (e.g., South African Rand), potentially from various angles and lighting conditions, to train the AI to identify and verify payment.
    *   **Kaggle Search Terms:** "currency recognition," "banknote detection," "South African Rand images" (or specific currency).

## 2. The AI Security Guard (Automated Loss Prevention)

*   **Theft Detection & Suspicious Activity Flagging:**
    *   **Dataset Needs:** Datasets of video or image sequences depicting both normal customer/staff behavior and various scenarios of theft or suspicious activities (e.g., shoplifting, unusual cash drawer access). This is crucial for training the AI to differentiate between normal and anomalous events.
    *   **Kaggle Search Terms:** "theft detection," "anomaly detection video," "surveillance footage," "human activity recognition retail."

## 3. The Autonomous Supply Chain Manager

*   **Predictive Demand Forecasting:**
    *   **Dataset Needs:** Historical sales data (product, quantity, date, price), along with relevant external factors such as local event schedules, weather data, and public holidays. This data is used to train models that predict future demand.
    *   **Kaggle Search Terms:** "sales forecasting," "demand prediction," "retail sales data," "time series sales."

*   **Smart Supplier Management:**
    *   **Dataset Needs:** Datasets containing supplier information, product catalogs, and historical pricing data from different suppliers for various products. This allows the AI to compare prices and recommend optimal purchasing decisions.
    *   **Kaggle Search Terms:** "supplier data," "product pricing," "e-commerce product data," "supply chain optimization."

## 4. The Generative Business Advisor (Conversational BI)

*   This feature primarily leverages the Google Gemini API's natural language capabilities and the internal business data generated by the other features (sales, inventory, profit) rather than requiring a separate external dataset for its own training. Its "dataset" is the aggregated business data from the other modules.
